Happy new year! 


Last week, we had a great event with the java user group Bangladesh. It was an offline event. We named it “The Java Developers Conference 2021”. After the pandemic, when everything was closed, we couldn’t do any in-person event, so this was our way of coming back. 


We had five tracks and a panel discussion with an influential audience presence. 


Here is the speaker lineup: [https://jugbd.org/blog/java-developers-conference-speaker-lineup/](https://jugbd.org/blog/java-developers-conference-speaker-lineup/)


We thank everyone who participated in the event. The community as a whole is the real benefactor of such an event. Such an event is merely a platform that helps to build bridges with everyone. We hope all the participants took their opportunity to talk to each other, share their ideas, and create their professional network, which is its ultimate goal. 


We’d like to express our appreciation to the speakers who were able to share their valuable experience and knowledge that ultimately made the event a successful one. 


Organizing such an event is not an easy job. Lots of hard work went into making this event go off so smoothly. Finding a venue, inviting attendees and speakers, renting lights, camera, sound system, internet, recording devices, display, making t-shirts, banners, stands, backdrops, attendee badges,  arranging snacks and refreshments, and a lot of other small details go into making an event. Luckily, we had a great team of volunteers, and everyone did a splendid job. I would like to convey my heartfelt gratitude towards all of them.


Finally, the essential part of such an event is funding. We would like to extend our gratitude and thank bKash for being a partner of this event. I hope we will get you along the way in the future event. 


Here are some photos of the event:
