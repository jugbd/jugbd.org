Netty is one of the most popular and widely used asynchronous event-driven network application frameworks.

Netty uses event-driven threading architecture over the traditional thread-per-request model. We will not cover every single detail of netty in this short speech. Instead, we will compare netty's threading model with the traditional one. We will also go through some essential areas of netty to understand the implementation, for example, the event-loop and the SocketChannel.

How do you grow from a junior programmer to a senior one? Surprisingly many programmers do not know the right answer. They keep on working for many years, only to be replaced by newcomers. They try to switch jobs, only to be rejected. They conclude there are no jobs for senior programmers in the country. On the other hand, the best companies in the country are desperately looking for senior programmers.
