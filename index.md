Java User Group Bangladesh (JUGBD) is a volunteer organization that strives to disseminate Java-related knowledge. The primary vision of JUGBD is to continue meeting regularly. All the folks here are very cool and passionate about Java. That brings a cozy environment to talk to each other and learn new things.

Pre-COVID, we used to meet a place and then talk, share resources and solutions, increase networking, expand Java Technology expertise, and above all, drink coke, eat pizza and most importanlty have fun. 

Since then, we have been doing everything virtually and operating through the Facebook group. It also gave us the opportunity to go beyond the border. We bring 
many international and renowned speakers with great talks. 

**Join the group to follow all our activities.**
