# How to create a post? 

We use Jekyll to publish content to the site.  

You’ll find a folder called _posts. To create a new post you’ll need to create a new markdown file with a file name in this format:

`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

The format is the four-digit year, followed by a hyphen then a two-digit month, followed by another hyphen and two-digit day, followed by a hyphenated title, and ending with the markdown file extension.

Now that you’ve got your new post file, you’ll have to add in a few more things before you’re ready to write your post. Up at the top of your new post file, you’ll have to add in some keys and values. 

Examples -
